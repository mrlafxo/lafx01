      <description>Level Goal
The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0.
Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.
Short Lesson
What is SSH?
 Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.
Short Lesson
Useful commands:
 The &amp;lsquo;ls&amp;rsquo; command displays a list of names of all files in the current directory.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory.
Short Lesson
 Every command in Linux may be followed by one or more options. An options is passed to a command with the &#39; - &#39; character.
  For example, to also list all the hidden files in the current directory, we can use:
  ls -a  Solution We may be tempted to simply enter the following:</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.
Solution In order to access file or directories with spaces in their name, we have to 2 ways:
 Specifying the file / dir name in quotation marks:  bandit2@bandit:~$ cat &amp;#34;spaces in this filename&amp;#34; UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK Escaping the space in the file / dir name:  bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK  We successfully found the password for Level 3!</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.
Solution In order to list hidden files inside a directory, we must use the ls command with the -a (all) switch:
bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -a . .. .hidden Alternatively we could also use the long listing format (-l) in conjunction with the -a switch, in order to check permissions and to understand if we are dealing with files or directories:</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.
Solution We can solve this level in three ways:
 With the file command:  Short Lesson
 The file command is used to determine the type of a file. File type may be of human-readable (e.g. ‘ASCII text’) or MIME type(e.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
 human-readable 1033 bytes in size not executable  Solution Short Lesson
 The find command in UNIX is a command line utility for walking a file hierarchy. It can be used to find files and directories and perform subsequent operations on them. It supports searching by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner and permissions.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
 owned by user bandit7 owned by group bandit6 33 bytes in size  Solution Like we did in the previous level, we can use the find command:
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c The problem with this command is that the terminal will also print out all the files for which we don&amp;rsquo;t have read permissions.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth.
Solution Short Lesson
 The grep command is used to search text. It searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words. It is one of the most useful commands on Linux and Unix-like system.
 The given file is composed by a hundreds of lines containing a word followed by a password.</description>

      <guid>/posts/overthewire/level09/</guid>
      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once.
Solution The provided file is a collection of multiple passwords. Some of the passwords are repeated through the file. Our goal is to find the password that appears only one. We will be using two new commands, sort and uniq.
Short Lesson
 The sort command is used to sort a file, arranging the records in a particular order.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.
Solution Let&amp;rsquo;s first check the data type of the file we are given:
bandit9@bandit:~$ file data.txt data.txt: data Short Lesson
 The .data file extension is given to the data files that have been created by and used for a variety of different software applications.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.
Solution Short Lesson
 In computer science, base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation.
  The base64 command is useful to base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output.
 We have to base64 decode the given file, so we will use the -d switch (decode):</description>

      <guid>/posts/overthewire/level12/</guid>
      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.
Solution If we try to read the content of the file data.txt we can see that the message has been encoded:
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh The level description suggests that we are dealing with a ROT13 (rotate by 13 places) substitution cipher.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)
Solution Short Lesson
 In computing, a hex dump is a hexadecimal view of computer data, from RAM or from a computer file or storage device.</description>

      <guid>/posts/overthewire/level14/</guid>
      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.
Solution We have to connect on port 30000 on the current machine. We can do that with the nc command.
 netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable &amp;ldquo;back-end&amp;rdquo; tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.</description>

      <guid>/posts/overthewire/level16/</guid>
      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.
Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…
Solution This level is the same as the previous one, except for the fact that we have to connect using SSL.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.</description>

      <guid>/posts/overthewire/level18/</guid>
      <description>Level Goal
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new.
NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19.
Solution Basically we have to find the differences between the two files provided.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the home directory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.
Solution When we try to login to level 18 with the previously discovered password, we are informed that the connection is closed.
Byebye ! Connection to bandit.labs.overthewire.org closed. This is why the .bashrc file was modified and is not letting to connect.</description>

      <guid>/posts/overthewire/level20/</guid>
      <description>Level Goal
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the home directory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.
Solution Short Lesson
 The Unix access rights flags setuid and setgid (short for &amp;ldquo;set user ID&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;set group ID&amp;rdquo;) allow users to run an executable with the file system permissions of the executable&amp;rsquo;s owner or group respectively and to change behaviour in directories.</description>

      <guid>/posts/overthewire/level21/</guid>
      <description>Level Goal
There is a setuid binary in the home directory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).
NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
Solution Short Lesson
 Cron allows Linux and Unix users to run commands or scripts at a given date and time. You can schedule scripts to be executed periodically. Cron is one of the most useful tool in a Linux or UNIX like operating systems.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!
NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…</description>

      <guid>/posts/overthewire/level25/</guid>
      <description>Level Goal
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
Solution For this level we will have to write our own script. But before that, what is brute forcing?
Short Lesson
 In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.
Solution Under the working directory we have a SSH Private Key that we can use to connect to the next level:
bandit25@bandit:~$ ls bandit26.sshkey bandit25@bandit:~$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey localhost -l bandit26 -t /bin/sh Could not create directory &amp;#39;/home/bandit25/.</description>

      <description>Level Goal
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!
Solution Note: This level will assume that we are in this shell obtained in the previous level.
The working directory has a script named bandit27-do. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what it does:
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do Run a command as another user. Example: ./bandit27-do id We can run any command with it, so let&amp;rsquo;s read the password for the next level!</description>

      <description>Level Goal
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.
Solution For this level we have to download a git repository stored online.
Short Lesson
 Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
 First we will create a directory under /tmp where we have write permissions:</description>
